    <p>The universe is widely believed to have originated from the Big Bang, an event occurring approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This explosive expansion marked the beginning of time and space, leading to the formation of elementary particles and eventually, atoms. The universe's initial state was incredibly hot and dense, cooling over time to allow for the formation of complex structures like galaxies.</p>

    <p>One intriguing aspect of the universe is its composition, with dark matter and dark energy constituting about 95% of its total mass-energy content, yet remaining largely mysterious. Dark matter, instrumental in the formation of galaxies, interacts through gravity but not electromagnetically, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects. Dark energy, even more enigmatic, is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.</p>

   <p>A fun fact about the universe is the concept of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). This is the afterglow of the Big Bang, discovered accidentally in 1965, and serves as a snapshot of the infant universe. The CMB provides crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory and has helped scientists understand the universe's early conditions, composition, and evolution over billions of years.</p>
